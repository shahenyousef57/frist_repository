        <h2> What is Web Development?</h2>
        <p>
            Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network).[1] Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.

Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web sites: writing markup and coding.[2] Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to make content changes easier and available with basic technical skills.

For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of hundreds of people (Web developers) and follow standard methods like Agile methodologies while developing Web sites.[1] Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment to related job positions such as a graphic designer or information systems technician. Web development may be a collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated department. There are three kinds of Web developer specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack developer.[3] Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in the user browser, while back-end developers deal with the servers. Since the commercialization of the Web with Tim Berners-Lee[4] developing the World Wide Web at CERN, the industry has boomed and has become one of the most used technologies ever.

        <h1>Wikibooks article on Web Development</h1>
        <p>As of December 27, 2006, the Wikibooks article on Web development consists mostly of a taxonomy of the subject area. However, since I do not agree with a lot of it, I am not going to reproduce it in this Wikipedia article rewrite. But I am also not volunteering to edit anything in Wikibooks. If this inconsistency causes problems, please raise them here. Chris Loosley 02:21, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
        <h1>Relationship to other articles</h1>
        <p>I view Web development as a particular instance of a Software development process, which is itself a Wikipedia category comprising many articles. I intend to reflect these relationships in the structure and content of the rewritten article. Chris Loosley 03:45, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
        <h1>Distinction between development process and methodology</h1>
        <p>I know that many informal approaches to Web development do not identify as distinct activities each task of the more formal software development processes. Nonetheless, I believe that a formal software development process identifies a collection of tasks that are essential to the production of effective software. So while people may adopt many different methodologies (or approaches) for addressing the work, those essential tasks must still be performed -- somehow, by someone -- during any development process. By addressing this distinction in the rewrite, I plan to cover both small-scale and large-scale Web development. Chris Loosley 03:45, 27 December 2006 (UTC). Website development companies have now also started using the agile development methodology for development, along with the more popular traditional waterfall methodology.</p>
