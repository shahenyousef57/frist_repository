        <h2> What is programming Languages</h2>
        <p>
            A programming language is a system of notation for writing computer programs.[1] Most programming languages are text-based formal languages, but they may also be graphical. They are a kind of computer language.
            The description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of syntax (form) and semantics (meaning), which are usually defined by a formal language. Some languages are defined by a specification document (for example, the C programming language is specified by an ISO Standard) while other languages (such as Perl) have a dominant implementation that is treated as a reference. Some languages have both, with the basic language defined by a standard and extensions taken from the dominant implementation being common.
            Programming language theory is the subfield of computer science that studies the design, implementation, analysis, characterization, and classification of programming languages.            

        </p>
        <h1>Computer languages vs programming languages</h1>
        <p>The term computer language is sometimes used interchangeably with programming language.[2] However, the usage of both terms varies among authors, including the exact scope of each. One usage describes programming languages as a subset of computer languages.[3] Similarly, languages used in computing that have a different goal than expressing computer programs are generically designated computer languages. For instance, markup languages are sometimes referred to as computer languages to emphasize that they are not meant to be used for programming.[4] One way of classifying computer languages is by the computations they are capable of expressing, as described by the theory of computation. The majority of practical programming languages are Turing complete,[5] and all Turing complete languages can implement the same set of algorithms. ANSI/ISO SQL-92 and Charity are examples of languages that are not Turing complete, yet are often called programming languages.[6][7] However, some authors restrict the term "programming language" to Turing complete languages.[1][8]

            Another usage regards programming languages as theoretical constructs for programming abstract machines and computer languages as the subset thereof that runs on physical computers, which have finite hardware resources.[9] John C. Reynolds emphasizes that formal specification languages are just as much programming languages as are the languages intended for execution. He also argues that textual and even graphical input formats that affect the behavior of a computer are programming languages, despite the fact they are commonly not Turing-complete, and remarks that ignorance of programming language concepts is the reason for many flaws in input formats.</p>
            <h1>Domain and target</h1>
            <p>In most practical contexts, a programming language involves a computer; consequently, programming languages are usually defined and studied this way.[11] Programming languages differ from natural languages in that natural languages are only used for interaction between people, while programming languages also allow humans to communicate instructions to machines.

                The domain of the language is also worth consideration. Markup languages like XML, HTML, or troff, which define structured data, are not usually considered programming languages. Programming languages may, however, share the syntax with markup languages if a computational semantics is defined. XSLT, for example, is a Turing complete language entirely using XML syntax. Moreover, LaTeX, which is mostly used for structuring documents, also contains a Turing complete subset.</p>
                <h1>Abstractions</h1>
                <p>Programming languages usually contain abstractions for defining and manipulating data structures or controlling the flow of execution. The practical necessity that a programming language support adequate abstractions is expressed by the abstraction principle.[20] This principle is sometimes formulated as a recommendation to the programmer to make proper use of such abstractions.</p>

                <p>JavaScript is a high-level programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. It is used as a client-side programming language by 97.8 percent of all websites. JavaScript was originally used only to develop web browsers, but they are now used for server-side website deployments and non-web browser applications as well. 

Javascript was created in 1995 and was initially known as LiveScript. However, Java was a very popular language at that time, so it was advertised as a “younger brother” of Java. As it evolved over time, JavaScript became a fully independent language. Nowadays, JavaScript is often confused with Java, and although there are some similarities between them, the two languages are distinct.

Javascript is the most popular programming language in the world and is in high demand among various organizations. The average Java developer earns around $112,152 each year.</p>

<h1>HTML </h1>

<p>HTML(HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language for creating web pages and applications. HTML is used to create web pages. You can use HTML to add images, links, and other types of content to your web page. HTML is a simple programming language; you don't need to know much about it to create a basic web page.

    Images and other objects, such as interactive forms, can be embedded within the produced page using HTML structures. It enables the creation of structured documents by indicating structural semantics for text elements including as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotations, and other objects. HTML elements are delineated by tags, which are written in angle brackets.</p>
    <h3>Benefits of HTML</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Benefits of using HTML include creating well-structured, standards-compliant web pages that are easy to maintain and update. 
            <li> HTML is also easy to learn and is a great starting point for those new to web development.</li>
           <li>HTML is used to structure and present content on the web and is typically used alongside CSS and JavaScript.</li>  
            <li>Additionally, HTML5 provides better multimedia and interactive content support, making it a powerful tool for creating engaging web experiences.</li>
            <li>HTML5 is the latest version and includes new features like video and audio elements, local storage, and 2D/3D graphics. HTML5 is designed to be more user-friendly and efficient than previous versions of HTML</li>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Cons of HTML
    </h1>
    <h4>A few potential drawbacks exist to using HTML as a web development language. 
    </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            
            First, because HTML is a markup language, it is not as expressive as a programming language like JavaScript or PHP, which means that complex web applications or pages can be more challenging to develop in HTML. 
        <li>
            Additionally, HTML is not a very secure language, so web developers must carefully encode any user input to prevent security vulnerabilities properly.
        </li>
        <li>
            Finally, HTML can be somewhat challenging to learn for newcomers, as it has a lot of different elements and syntax rules
